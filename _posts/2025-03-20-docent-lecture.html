<p>This morning I gave my lecture for my docent application at the faculty of science and technology at university of gothenburg.</p>

<p>
  I explained that a computer is a simple device that can take input and produce output. Using it, we can make them do things. They can be cumbersome to get to do certain things, but once they can do them it is often trivial to replicate.
</p>

<p>
  I went through four examples from my research, where I have had to make the computer do: buttons, maps, steps counts, and screen time.
</p>

<p>
With AI, this may come to change. Computers are great at instructing themselves, and capable of understanding us on our own terms. What does this mean for the future? Will there be developers? Will there be apps? Will there be computers as we know them? Or will we just have machines, and they will do things we ask them to do.
</p>

<p>I took this opportunity to talk about where I see things going next, and what I think could be an interesting future worth exploring.</p>
